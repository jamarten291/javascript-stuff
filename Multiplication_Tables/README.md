# Multiplication tables

This is the code of a webpage that I created, this program shows the multiplication tables you want (from 1 to 10) and asks you for the answer

It shows in real time if you have mistakes or if you got your answer right.


# Installation

1. You can clone my repository by writing the following command:
```bash git clone https://github.com/jamarten291/javascript-stuff/Multiplication_Tables```

2. Open the html in a web browser for testing the program, open the code if you wish to change something.


# Usage of my program

This program is useful for children or for people that just want to test their math skills, you put the number of the table you want inside of the textbox and it will show you a table with fields where you can put your answer.
